# Project1 (Date Night Planner Application)

## Overview<
This is an important step in my full-stack journey as I will now use my newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With my team, I will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because I will be working collaboratively, I will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Hereâ€™s how the app works:
In the application user can plan to date at home by click on dinner page to pick the restaurant they want the food to be delivery to their home. User can search for the restaurant near by their house by entering their address or just entering their zipcode.Also, select the type of food that they want it to be delivery.After order the food the user can click on the movie side to find the movie they want to watch .
